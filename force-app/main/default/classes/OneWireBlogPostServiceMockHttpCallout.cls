However, many\\u00a0companies prefer candidates with their Masters or PhD.

Data scientists also must have excellent communication skills. Conveying complex data concepts into simple terms might be difficult for technology professionals, but this quality distinguishes data scientists from their peers. Resourcefulness, project management skills and creativity are also crucial ingredients for success.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Salary<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Data scientists are hard to find, and companies are willing to pay handsomely for it.
