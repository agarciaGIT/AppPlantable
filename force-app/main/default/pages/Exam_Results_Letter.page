        As with many things of value, successfully completing the ERP Exam requires a patient, concerted effort. A number of serious individuals have attempted the exam more than once before earning the 
        ERP designation. Like them, we also encourage you to participate in the ERP Exam again in the future.

        Thank you for participating in the <strong>{! examDate } FRM® Exam Part I and the FRM® Exam Part II</strong>. After a thorough review of your individual performance, we regret to inform you that your 
        FRM Exam Part I score did not meet the necessary requirements for passing. As a consequence of not passing the FRM Exam Part I, we did not score your FRM Exam Part II.

        <p>
        The FRM Exam is a challenging test covering a wide variety of risk management topics and is designed to evaluate whether candidates have the knowledge, skills and 
        abilities needed to function effectively in the field of risk management. As with many things of value, the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities take a patient, 
        concerted effort to obtain and many serious individuals require more than one attempt to succeed.
        </p>
                
        <p>
        In our continuing effort to provide useful feedback about the Exam, we invite you to view an analysis of your test results, including information about your individual 
        performance relative to all other FRM candidates who sat for the {! examMonth } Exam. Please login to <apex:outputLink value="https://my.garp.org/Login?start=myprograms">your account</apex:outputLink> and go to 
        “My Programs” to view an analysis of your <apex:outputLink value="https://my.garp.org/Login?start=exam_results">exam performance</apex:outputLink> based on quartile rankings for each section of the FRM curriculum evaluated on the exam.
        </p>
                
        <p>
        While your results may be disappointing, we encourage you to try again and take the FRM Exam Part I in the future.
