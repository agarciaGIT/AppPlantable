                                As you may have seen in an email we sent you earlier this week, GARP is phasing out the ERP after
                                2021 due to changes in the marketplace. However, we will be offering Part II in May and November
                                2021 for candidates like you who want to complete their studies. Those who pass Part II in 2021 will
                                still have five years to submit the work requirements to become certified. In addition, GARP will
                                continue to offer Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for ERPs.
                            </p>

                                As you know from the recent email we sent you, GARP has made the difficult decision to discontinue the ERP after 2021 due to changes in the marketplace. We are no longer offering ERP Part I for new registrants and will phase out the Part II Exam after 2021.

                                GARP has been building curricula in new focus areas for risk management that will benefit energy professionals and we recommend registering for one of these if you would like to continue your risk management education. These include:                           
                                
                                <ul>

                                        The Sustainability and Climate Risk (<a href="https://www.garp.org/scr">SCR™</a>) certificate program, which launched in early 2020 and saw more than 1,200 candidates in its first year. Focused on building a holistic range of knowledge around climate risk, the SCR includes, among other things, in-depth coverage on the energy transition to renewables and addresses other sustainability, governance, and disclosure issues.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        GARP’s Financial Risk Manager (<a href="https://www.garp.org/frm">FRM®</a>), the gold standard in risk management education. We continue to refresh its curriculum every year to keep up to date with the growing and evolving discipline of risk management.

                                To complete the ERP Certification process, you will need to demonstrate two years of professional work experience. Once Certified, you may use the ERP designation on professional correspondences.
