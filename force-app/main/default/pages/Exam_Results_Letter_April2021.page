                        SCR Certificate holders are also strongly advised to participate in GARP’s Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program, which offers access to a broad range of accessible learning opportunities as well as the tools you need to track and document your activities. While participation in CPD is voluntary, the program is a great opportunity to stay up to date with industry trends and demonstrate commitment to the profession.
